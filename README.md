# Tic Tac Toe Game using JavaFX

A simple yet interactive Tic Tac Toe game developed using JavaFX, showcasing a graphical user interface with dynamic event handling, game state management, and restart functionality. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of JavaFX for desktop GUI applications.

## Features

- **Graphical Interface**: Designed using JavaFX layouts (`HBox`, `VBox`) and controls (`Button`, `Label`) for an intuitive and engaging game board.
- **Event-Driven Gameplay**: Utilizes JavaFX event handlers to manage user actions and update the game state in real time.
- **Game State Management**: Implements a 3x3 matrix to track player moves, with built-in logic for turn management, win condition detection, and draw scenarios.
- **Restart Functionality**: Includes an option to restart the game, allowing seamless replay without restarting the application.
- **Error Handling and Robustness**: Features comprehensive error checks to maintain gameplay integrity and handle incorrect inputs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- JavaFX SDK

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OliviaCoding/tic-tac-toe-javafx.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).

3. Ensure the JavaFX library is properly set up in your project settings.

### Running the Application

1. Navigate to the `TikTakToeTester` class.
2. Run the `main` method to start the application.

## How to Play

1. The game is played between two players: Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).
2. Players take turns clicking on empty buttons to mark their symbol (X or O).
3. The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
